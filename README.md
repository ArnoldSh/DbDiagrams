# DbDiagrams
  Simple JS library for visualization database structure.
  Based on JointJS library.
  
  For build use <b>npm</b> ang <b>gulp</b> commands:

    npm install
    gulp

  Output folder <i>test</i> contains copy of dist and test page (<i>/test/html/index.html</i>).
  
  If everything is OK you should get something like that:

# Comming soon
  At now DbDiagrams has not any API docs and specification of application protocol (raw JSON object) that describes metadata of database. Someday I shall do :)
